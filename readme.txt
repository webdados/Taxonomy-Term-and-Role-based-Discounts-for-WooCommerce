Automatically apply WooCommerce discounts/pricing rules based on product category, tag, attribute, custom taxonomy, and user role — no coupons needed

== Description ==

Create automatic WooCommerce price discounts based on product category, tag, attribute, brand, or any custom taxonomy, and apply them to all users, logged-in users, or only to specific WordPress user roles.

Each discount rule can have a start and end date.

* Create WooCommerce discounts based on the product category, tag, brand, type, or shipping class;
* Create WooCommerce discounts based on any product attribute;
* Create WooCommerce discounts based on any custom taxonomy, created by you or any 3rd party plugin;
* Create WooCommerce discounts based on the user role;
* Schedule the special pricing by setting a date range on the discount rule;
* WPML compatible (ability to set discounts on different language terms, not compatible with multi-currency);
* WooCommerce Subscriptions experimental support;

= Discount types =

* Percentage: apply an absolute percentage discount to all the products on a specific taxonomy term;
* Buy x get y free (BOGO): offer free items when a minimum quantity is purchased;
* [PRO add-on](https://nakedcatplugins.com/product/taxonomy-term-and-role-based-discounts-for-woocommerce-pro-add-on/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=taxonomydiscounts_woocommerce_plugin) Fixed value: apply an absolute value discount to all the products on a specific taxonomy term;

= Get more with the PRO add-on =

* “Discount Tag” custom taxonomy if you don’t want to use Categories, Tags, or any other existing product taxonomy;
* Sitewide discounts: any discount type applied to all the store products, instead of just one taxonomy term
* Set the maximum amount of free items when using BOGO discounts;
* Replace the sale badge with a discount percentage;
* Replace the sale badge with a discount percentage, even if a taxonomy does not set the discount, but rather by setting a sale price on the product (in beta);
* Show discount information (percentage and dates) on the product loop;
* Show discount information (percentage and dates) on the product single page (mandatory on some legislations, like the Portuguese one, for example);
* Show discount information for non-taxonomy discounts (set by product sale price), including start and end date, thus allowing compliance with legislation, such as Portuguese law, which requires these details to be displayed next to the sale price;
* “Stop - no discount” rule that makes sure products from specific taxonomy terms never have a discount applied, even if there are other rules that will apply for other product taxonomy terms;
* Exclude products already on sale from the discount rule: always, or if taxonomy discount is lower, or if taxonomy discount is higher;
* Set base price for on-sale products: sale price (discount on top of discount) or original regular price (new option);
* Disable shipping methods based on cart items applied rules;
* Set discount rules for non-logged-in users;
* [Google Product Feed for WooCommerce](https://automattic.pxf.io/EEJQd4) integration
* Developer mode - [more info](https://nakedcatplugins.com/product/taxonomy-term-and-role-based-discounts-for-woocommerce-pro-add-on/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=taxonomydiscounts_woocommerce_plugin);

= Notes =

* The discounts are applied on a “per cart line” basis (not to the sum of the products of the same taxonomy) - this means that if you set a discount with a minimum quantity, it will only be applied if the customer buys that quantity of the same product;
* Only one rule is applied per cart line, so setting the priorities correctly is very important;
* When aggregating product variations, the quantity will be the sum of the quantities of all the variations of the same product in the cart, and the discount will be applied to all of them;
* For WPML users, if you want the same discounts to apply to all the languages, you must replicate the rules for each of the translations of the terms
* You can use the `tdw_rule_add`, `tdw_rule_edit`, and `tdw_rule_delete` actions when adding, editing, and deleting rules, to do whatever you want, like, for example, clearing cache ([check out to use them here](https://gist.github.com/webdados/98282475fbee2be347eba45ad81cbba5) and send us cool examples of what you’ve done)

== Installation ==

1. Use the included automatic install feature on your WordPress admin panel and search for “taxonomy/term role discounts”.
2. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress
3. Go to `Products`, `Taxonomy Discounts` to set it up

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin apply discounts automatically without coupons? =

Yes. Discounts are applied automatically at cart/checkout based on the product’s taxonomy terms and the customer’s user role — no coupon code is required.

= Can I set bulk discounts or quantity-based pricing in WooCommerce? =

Yes. You can set a minimum quantity per rule, enabling bulk or tiered pricing for product categories, tags, or any other taxonomy.
Keep in mind the quantity is per individual product in the cart, not all products from the same taxonomy.

= Can I set different prices for wholesale customers? =

Yes. By combining taxonomy rules with WordPress user roles (e.g., a “Wholesale” role), you can create role-based or wholesale pricing rules.

= Why is my product not showing the “Sale” badge? =

We can only show the “sale” badge when we are sure the product will get a discount, no matter how many you buy. The badge is shown only for percentage-based rules with no minimum quantity required.

= How can I replace the sale badge with the discount percentage? =

This only works for percentage discounts with a minimum quantity of 0 or 1, and you need to add this to your (child-)theme functions.php file:

`add_filter( 'tdw_perc_sale_badge', '__return_true' );`

Or you can use the [PRO add-on](https://nakedcatplugins.com/product/taxonomy-term-and-role-based-discounts-for-woocommerce-pro-add-on/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=taxonomydiscounts_woocommerce_plugin)

= How can I display discount information in the product loop and on the page? =

You need to use the following filters:

* `tdw_loop_disc_info_action` and `tdw_loop_disc_info_prio`: to set the hook and priority for the loop page and return, for example, `woocommerce_after_shop_loop_item_title` and `1`
* `tdw_single_disc_info_action` and `tdw_single_disc_info_prio`: to set the hook and priority for the product page and return, for example, `woocommerce_single_product_summary` and `6`
(This is for Storefront. You may have to tweak the action and priority to match your theme better.)

Or you can use the [PRO add-on](https://nakedcatplugins.com/product/taxonomy-term-and-role-based-discounts-for-woocommerce-pro-add-on/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=taxonomydiscounts_woocommerce_plugin)

= How can I get the current product or variation price, with the discount applied, outside the loop? =

You can use the `wctd_get_product_current_price` helper function with the product or variation object or ID as the first argument.

You can also pass the quantity as the second argument to calculate percentage discounts with a minimum quantity greater than 1, or “buy x get y free” discounts. The returned price will be the unit price.

This is still beta.

= Will this work on multi-currency shops? =

No. The way we store cart item prices is not currently compatible with stores that allow customers to change currency during the shopping session.

= Is this plugin compatible with the new WooCommerce High-Performance Order Storage? =

Yes.

= Is this plugin compatible with the new WooCommerce block-based Cart and Checkout? =

Yes.

= I need help, can I get technical support? =

Only customers of the [PRO add-on](https://nakedcatplugins.com/product/taxonomy-term-and-role-based-discounts-for-woocommerce-pro-add-on/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=taxonomydiscounts_woocommerce_plugin) get included limited technical support.

= Can I contribute to this plugin? =
Yes, on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Naked-Cat-Plugins/Taxonomy-Term-and-Role-based-Discounts-for-WooCommerce).

= Can I contribute with a translation? =
