Lets you configure discounts/pricing rules for products based on any product taxonomy terms and WordPress user roles

== Description ==

Lets you configure discounts/pricing rules for products based on any WooCommerce product taxonomy terms (built-in or custom), in a very simple way.

The discount can be applied for all users, logged-in users, or only for certain WordPress user roles.

Allows you to set a start and end date for each discount.

* Create WooCommerce discounts based on the product category, tag, type, or shipping class.
* Create WooCommerce discounts based on any product attribute.
* Create WooCommerce discounts based on any custom taxonomy, like brand, for example.

* WPML compatible (ability to set discounts on different languages term, not compatible with multi-currency).
* WooCommerce Subscriptions experimental support.

= Discount types =

* Percentage: apply an absolute percentage discount to all the products on a specific taxonomy term;
* Buy x get y free (BOGO): offer y items when x (of the same product) are bought;

= Get more with the PRO add-on =

* “Discount Tag” custom taxonomy if you don’t want to use Categories, Tags, or any other existing product taxonomy;
* Sitewide discounts (applied to all the store products)
* Set the maximum amount of free items when using BOGO discounts;
* Replace the sale badge with a discount percentage;
* Replace the sale badge with a discount percentage, even if the discount is not set by a taxonomy but rather by setting a sale price on the product (in beta);
* Show discount information (percentage and dates) on the product loop;
* Show discount information (percentage and dates) on the product single page (mandatory on some legislations, like the Portuguese one, for example);
* “Stop - no discount” rule that makes sure products from specific taxonomy terms never have a discount applied, even if there are other rules that will apply for other product taxonomy terms;
* Exclude products already on sale from the discount rule: always, or if taxonomy discount is lower, or if taxonomy discount is higher;
* Set base price for on-sale products: sale price (discount on top of discount) or original regular price (new option);
* Disable shipping methods based on cart items applied rules;
* Set discount rules for non-logged-in users;
* Developer mode - [more info](https://nakedcatplugins.com/product/taxonomy-term-and-role-based-discounts-for-woocommerce-pro-add-on/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=taxonomydiscounts_woocommerce_plugin);

= Notes =

* The discounts are applied on a “per cart line” basis (not to the sum of the products of the same taxonomy);
* Only one rule is applied per cart line, so setting the priorities correctly is very important;
* When aggregating product variations, the quantity will be the sum of the quantities of all the variations and the discount will be applied to all of them;
* For WPML users, if you want the same discounts to apply to all the languages, you must replicate the rules for each of the translations of the terms
* You can use the `tdw_rule_add`, `tdw_rule_edit`, and `tdw_rule_delete` actions when adding, editing, and deleting rules, to do whatever you want like, for example, clearing cache ([check out to use them here](https://gist.github.com/webdados/98282475fbee2be347eba45ad81cbba5) and send us cool examples of what you’ve done)

== Installation ==

1. Use the included automatic install feature on your WordPress admin panel and search for “Taxonomy / Term based Discounts for WooCommerce”.
2. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress
3. Got to `Products`, `Taxonomy Discounts` to set it up

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is my product not showing the “Sale” badge? =

We can only show the “sale” badge when we are absolutely sure the product will get a discount, no matter how many you buy.
So, the badge is only shown for percentage base rules with no minimum quantity required.

= How can I show the discount information on the product loop and page? =

You need to use the following filters:

* `tdw_loop_disc_info_action` and `tdw_loop_disc_info_prio`: to set the hook and priority for the loop page and return, for example, `woocommerce_after_shop_loop_item_title` and `1`
* `tdw_single_disc_info_action` and `tdw_single_disc_info_prio`: to set the hook and priority for the product page and return, for example, `woocommerce_single_product_summary` and `6`
(This is for Storefront. You may have to tweak the action and priority to better match your theme.)

Or you can just use the [PRO add-on](https://nakedcatplugins.com/product/taxonomy-term-and-role-based-discounts-for-woocommerce-pro-add-on/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=taxonomydiscounts_woocommerce_plugin)

= How can I replace the sale badge with the discount percentage? =

This only works for percentage discounts with a minimum quantity of 0 or 1, and you need to add this to your (child-)theme functions.php file:

`add_filter( 'tdw_perc_sale_badge', '__return_true' );`

Or you can just use the [PRO add-on](https://nakedcatplugins.com/product/taxonomy-term-and-role-based-discounts-for-woocommerce-pro-add-on/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=taxonomydiscounts_woocommerce_plugin)

= How can I get the current product or variation price, with the discount applied, outside the loop? =

You can use the `wctd_get_product_current_price` helper function with the product or variation object or id as the first argument.

You can also pass the quantity as the second argument so that the calculations are made for percentage discounts with a minimum quantity higher than one or for “buy x get y free” discounts. The returned price will be the price per unit.

This is still beta.

= Will this work on multi-currency shops? =

No. The way we store the cart item prices is not currently compatible with stores where the customer can change currency during the shopping session.

= Is this plugin compatible with the new WooCommerce High-Performance Order Storage? =

Yes.

= Is this plugin compatible with the new WooCommerce block-based Cart and Checkout? =

Yes.

= Can I contribute with a translation? =

Sure. Go to [GlotPress](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/taxonomy-discounts-woocommerce) and help us out.

= I need help, can I get technical support? =

Only customers of the [PRO add-on](https://nakedcatplugins.com/product/taxonomy-term-and-role-based-discounts-for-woocommerce-pro-add-on/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=taxonomydiscounts_woocommerce_plugin) get included limited technical support.
